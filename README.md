# lainos-iso
Modified Archiso profile with Calamares installer for LainOS ISO build; uses linux kernel 6.6.4-zen1-1.

This ISO build installs all of the packages found in the LainOS Arch script(https://codeberg.org/LainOS/LainOS-ricer-arch) using Calamares and leaves an installation with Hyprland and Openbox(Xfce is deleted during the installation). This ISO build precedes the final LainOS ISO build as the animated sddm theme, grub theme, and plymouth theme need to be included for completion.

Prerequisites: Have the LainOS repo (`git clone https://github.com/The-LainOS-Project/lainos_repo`) in a local repo and adjust `/airootfs/etc/pacman.conf` accordingly to use this repo.

To build this ISO, clone this repository, cd into it, and execute the following command to create the ISO:

`sudo mkarchiso -v -w /home/USER/work -o /home/USER/out /home/USER/lainos-iso/`

The ISO will appear in `/home/USER/out/` and the `/home/USER/work/` folder can be deleted.

After booting up the ISO, select Xfce session(Calamares only works in Xfce), then enter no password into the login prompt to enter the Xfce live installation environment.
